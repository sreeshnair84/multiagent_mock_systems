# Intune Device Provisioning Standard Operating Procedure

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Effective Date:** December 2025  
**Classification:** Internal Use Only

## Purpose

This SOP defines procedures for enrolling, managing, and decommissioning devices using Microsoft Intune Mobile Device Management (MDM).

## Scope

Applies to IT operations staff responsible for device provisioning and end users receiving corporate devices.

## Device Provisioning Workflow

### 1. Device Enrollment

**Prerequisites:**
- Device serial number
- User email (M365 account)
- Device profile selection (Standard, Mobile, Executive)

**Enrollment Steps:**
1. Receive device from procurement
2. Power on and connect to network
3. Use `provision_device` function with:
   - Serial number
   - User email
   - Profile name
   - OS version
4. System assigns Device ID (format: D001, D002, etc.)
5. Intune pushes configuration profile
6. Device status set to "Enrolled"

**Profile Types:**
- **Standard:** Windows 11, Office 365, VPN, antivirus
- **Mobile:** iOS/Android, email sync, conditional access
- **Executive:** Enhanced security, mobile threat defense

**Timeline:** Provisioning completes in 15-30 minutes

### 2. Device Profile Management

**Viewing Profiles:**
- Use `get_device_profile` to retrieve configuration
- Includes: OS version, last sync time, compliance status

**Profile Updates:**
- Changes pushed automatically via Intune
- Devices sync every 8 hours (or on-demand)

### 3. Device Status Tracking

**Status Values:**
- **Enrolled:** Active and compliant
- **Pending:** Enrollment in progress
- **Failed:** Enrollment error (requires troubleshooting)
- **Wiped:** Data remotely erased

**Status Updates:**
- Use `update_device_status` function
- Triggers compliance re-evaluation

### 4. Device Compliance Monitoring

**Compliance Checks:**
- OS version up-to-date
- Antivirus enabled and current
- Encryption enabled
- Screen lock configured (6-digit PIN minimum)

**Non-Compliance Actions:**
- Email notification to user
- Block access to corporate email after 24 hours
- Auto-create ServiceNow ticket for IT follow-up

### 5. Device Listing and Filtering

**Query Options:**
- By user email: `list_devices(user_email="user@company.com")`
- By status: `list_devices(status="Enrolled")`
- Combined filters supported

**Use Cases:**
- Audit user's devices
- Find non-compliant devices
- Inventory reporting

### 6. Device Wipe (Admin-Only)

**Authorization:** Requires Admin role

**Wipe Scenarios:**
- Device lost or stolen
- Employee termination
- Security breach

**Wipe Procedure:**
1. Verify admin credentials
2. Use `wipe_device` function with:
   - Device ID
   - Admin email
   - Confirmation=True (safety check)
3. Intune sends remote wipe command
4. Device erases all data on next sync
5. Status updated to "Wiped"
6. Audit log entry created

**Important:** Wipe is irreversible. Verify device ID before execution.

**Personal Devices:** Selective wipe removes only corporate data

## Device Sync and Troubleshooting

**Sync Frequency:**
- Automatic: Every 8 hours
- Manual: User can force sync via Company Portal app

**Common Issues:**
- **Enrollment Failed:** Check network connectivity, verify user account active
- **Compliance Failed:** Review specific policy violation, guide user to remediate
- **Sync Delayed:** Verify device online, check Intune service status

## Integration with Other Systems

- **M365:** Device enrollment triggers license assignment
- **ServiceNow:** Auto-create tickets for compliance failures
- **Access Management:** Device compliance required for SAP access
