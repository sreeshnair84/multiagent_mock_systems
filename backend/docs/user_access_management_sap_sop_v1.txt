# User Access Management (SAP) Standard Operating Procedure

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Effective Date:** December 2025  
**Classification:** Internal Use Only

## Purpose

This SOP governs the SAP-like access request workflow, including submission, approval, and provisioning of system access.

## Scope

Applies to all users requesting access to enterprise resources and approvers responsible for authorization decisions.

## Access Request Workflow

### 1. Submitting Access Requests

**Requester Actions:**
1. Navigate to Access Request Portal
2. Complete request form with:
   - Resource name (e.g., SAP Module A, SAP Module B)
   - Action required (Read, Write, Admin)
   - Business justification
3. Submit request (generates unique Request ID: REQ-XXXX)
4. Receive confirmation email

**Auto-Assignment:**
- Requests automatically routed to appropriate approver based on resource
- Requester notified of assigned approver

### 2. Approval Process

**Approver Requirements:**
- Must have "Approver" or "Admin" role
- Access to approval dashboard

**Approval Steps:**
1. Review pending requests in queue
2. Evaluate:
   - Business justification
   - User's current role and department
   - Risk level (Low/Medium/High)
   - Compliance requirements
3. Make decision:
   - **Approve:** Grant access, system auto-provisions
   - **Reject:** Provide detailed reason, notify requester

**SLA:** 48-hour response time for all requests

### 3. Request Status Tracking

**Status Values:**
- **Pending:** Awaiting approval
- **Approved:** Access granted
- **Rejected:** Access denied

**Tracking Methods:**
- Self-service portal: Check status by Request ID
- Email notifications on status changes
- Query via chatbot: "What is the status of my access request?"

### 4. Escalation Procedures

**Triggers for Escalation:**
- Request pending >48 hours
- High-priority business need
- Approver unavailable

**Escalation Path:**
1. Notify approver's manager
2. If no response in 24 hours, escalate to IT Director
3. Emergency access: Contact IT Operations (requires VP approval)

## Risk Assessment

**Risk Levels:**
- **Low:** Read-only access to non-sensitive modules
- **Medium:** Write access to operational modules
- **High:** Admin access, financial modules, HR data

**High-Risk Requirements:**
- Dual approval (manager + IT security)
- Mandatory security training completion
- Quarterly access review

## Exceptions

- **Urgent Business Need:** VP can approve emergency access (valid 24 hours)
- **Contractor Access:** Requires sponsor and expiration date
- **Audit Access:** Pre-approved for compliance team

## Integration with Other Systems

- **M365:** Approved requests trigger Graph API group membership
- **Outlook:** Approval emails with one-click approve/reject buttons
- **ServiceNow:** Auto-create ticket for provisioning failures
